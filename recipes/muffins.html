    <img src="/img/healthy-banana-muffins-recipe-1-550x757.jpg" alt="a picture of banana muffins"></a>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil*</li>
        <li>½ cup maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>2 eggs, preferably at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup packed mashed ripe bananas (about 3 bananas)</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk of choice or water (I used almond milk)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling on top</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup old-fashioned oats (optional), plus more for sprinkling on top</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turbinado (raw) sugar or other granulated sugar, for sprinkling on top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined. If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins**, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the coconut oil and maple syrup together with a whisk. Add the eggs and beat well. Mix in the mashed bananas and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats (about 1 tablespoon in total), followed by a light sprinkling of sugar (about 1 teaspoon in total). Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan. These muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed).</li>
    </ol>
